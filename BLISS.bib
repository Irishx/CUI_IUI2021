De Wlz wordt op landelijk niveau in opdracht van de rijksoverheid uitgevoerd door Wlz-uitvoerders. Daarnaast zijn er enkele andere organisaties betrokken bij de uitvoering, zoals het Centrum Indicatiestelling Zorg (CIZ) en het Centraal AdministratieKantoor (CAK). De uitvoering van de Wmo en de Jeugdwet ligt bij de gemeenten, die de ondersteuning, hulp of zorg zelf aanbieden of met de inzet van een zorgaanbieder.Drijfveren achter deze wetten zijn de kansen om de kwaliteit van de zorg te verbeteren, een integrale aanpak te bevorderen en de zorg in tijden van vergrijzing en chronische aandoeningen toegankelijk en betaalbaar te houden. Uitgangspunt in deze domeinen zijn niet de tekortkomingen, maar de mogelijkheden van mensen. In eerste instantie wordt er een beroep gedaan op het eigen netwerk en middelen voor ondersteuning, maar de ondersteuning is altijd beschikbaar voor diegenen die er niet zelf in kunnen voorzien.},

address = {Valetta, Malta},
annote = {Describes a method for providing a standard format for dialogue annotation. According to them, a dialog act has two components, a communicative function and semantic content. The semantic content specifices the objects, relations, actions, events, etc that the dialogue act is about; the communicative function can be viewed as a specification of the way an addressee uses the semantic content to update his or her information state when he or she understands the corresponding stretch of dialogue. Communicative functions are defined in terms of functional segments, which are functionally relevant minimal stretches of communicative behaviour.
Described is how feedback acts are concerned with the processing of what was said before (the utterance itself), whereas functional dependencies are concerned with the dialogue acts. A meta-model is displayed in Figure 1 to highlight the relations of dialogue acts to functional segments, semantic content and communicative function.
They mention dimensions again, see Bunt (2006) for more info about that. Next to dimensions, there are also criteria for communicative function described in 6.2, relevant for adding a possible extra dimension. There is also a distinction made between dimension-specific and general-purpose functions (see figure 2 for display of all general-purpose function).
Moreover, the ISO also has described in Table 1 phenomena relevant to dialogues, which are modality (certainty), mode (emotion), conditionality (conditions) and partiality (partial/complete). See Petukhova {\&} Bunt (2010) for further study.},

As systems must understand users' preferences , training them has called for conversational corpora, typically derived from task-oriented conversations. We observe that such corpora often do not reflect how people naturally describe preferences.

Studying the dialogues in one domain, we present a brief quantitative analysis of how people describe movie preferences at scale. Demonstrating the methodology, we release the CCPE-M dataset to the community with over 500 movie preference dialogues expressing over 10,000 preferences. 1},

In this concept, coaching takes the form of an open dialog in which clients co-construct together with a selected number of coaches their own plans to go for a healthier lifestyle. Virtual coaches are presented to users by means of embodied conversational social characters.

Flourish builds on Dr. Seligman's game-changing work on optimism, motivation, and character to show how to get the most out of life, unveiling an electrifying new theory of what makes a good life{\&}—for individuals, for communities, and for nations. In a fascinating evolution of thought and practice, Flourish refines what Positive Psychology is all about. While certainly a part of well-being, happiness alone doesn't give life meaning. Seligman now asks, What is it that enables you to cultivate your talents, to build deep, lasting relationships with others, to feel pleasure, and to contribute meaningfully to the world? In a word, what is it that allows you to flourish? “Well-being” takes the stage front and center, and Happiness (or Positive Emotion) becomes one of the five pillars of Positive Psychology, along with Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment{\&}—or PERMA, the permanent building blocks for a life of profound fulfillment. Thought-provoking in its implications for education, economics, therapy, medicine, and public policy{\&}—the very fabric of society{\&}—Flourish tells inspiring stories of Positive Psychology in action, including how the entire U.S. Army is now trained in emotional resilience; how innovative schools can educate for fulfillment in life and not just for workplace success; and how corporations can improve performance at the same time as they raise employee well-being. With interactive exercises to help readers explore their own attitudes and aims, Flourish is a watershed in the understanding of happiness as well as a tool for getting the most out of life},

Machteld Huber and colleagues propose changing the emphasis towards the ability to adapt and self manage in the face of social, physical, and emotional challenges$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe current WHO definition of health, formulated in 1948, describes health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”1 At that time this formulation was groundbreaking because of its breadth and ambition. It overcame the negative definition of health as absence of disease and included the physical, mental, and social domains. Although the definition has been criticised over the past 60 years, it has never been adapted. Criticism is now intensifying,2 3 4 5 and as populations age and the pattern of illnesses changes the definition may even be counterproductive. The paper summarises the limitations of the WHO definition and describes the proposals for making it more useful that were developed at a conference of international health experts held in the Netherlands.6$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMost criticism of the WHO definition concerns the absoluteness of the word “complete” in relation to wellbeing. The first problem is that it unintentionally contributes to the medicalisation of society. The requirement for complete health “would leave most of us unhealthy most of the time.”4 It therefore supports the tendencies of the medical technology and drug industries, in association with professional organisations, to redefine diseases, expanding the scope of the healthcare system. New screening technologies detect abnormalities at levels that might never cause illness and pharmaceutical companies produce drugs for “conditions” not previously defined as health problems. Thresholds for intervention tend to be lowered—for example, with blood pressure, lipids, and sugar. The persistent emphasis on complete physical well-being {\ldots}},

It presents the question answering task from an information retrieval perspective and emphasises the importance of retrieval models, i.e., representations of queries and information documents, and retrieval functions which are used for estimating the relevance between a query and an answer candidate. The survey suggests a general question answering architecture that steadily increases the complexity of the representation level of questions and information objects. On the one hand, natural language queries are reduced to keyword-based searches, on the other hand, knowledge bases are queried with structured or logical queries obtained from the natural language questions, and answers are obtained through reasoning. We discuss different levels of processing yielding bag-of-words-based and more complex representations integrating part-of-speech tags, classification of the expected answer type, semantic roles, discourse analysis, translation into a SQL-like language and logical representations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We especially consider the problem ofdesigning for long-term interaction, and define relational agents as compu- tational artifacts designed to establish and maintain long-term social-emotional relationships with their users. We construct the first such agent, and evaluate it in a controlled experiment with 101 users who were asked to interact daily with an exercise adoption system for a month. Compared to an equivalent task-oriented agent without any deliberate social-emotional or relationship-building skills, the relational agent was respected more, liked more, and trusted more, even after four weeks ofinteraction. Additionally, users expressed a significantly greater desire to continue working with the relational agent after the termination ofthe study. We conclude by discussing future directions for this research together with ethical and other ramifications of this work for HCI designers.},

    abstract = "Chit-chat models are known to have several problems: they lack specificity, do not display a consistent personality and are often not very captivating. In this work we present the task of making chit-chat more engaging by conditioning on profile information. We collect data and train models to (i)condition on their given profile information; and (ii) information about the person they are talking to, resulting in improved dialogues, as measured by next utterance prediction. Since (ii) is initially unknown our model is trained to engage its partner with personal topics, and we show the resulting dialogue can be used to predict profile information about the interlocutors.",

Robotisering is veelbesproken, omdat het belang van menswaardige aandacht voor zorgbehoevende mensen er door onder druk lijkt komen te staan.

Despite the preference for human professional healthcare, the new socio-economic situation and the decrease in care personnel make necessary to give support to the process of caregiving. In this context, Robotics can be considered as a solution since it can provide healthcare support, help in performing daily tasks, and/or increase the feeling of autonomony and self management. This paper is an overview of the existing robotic technologies for elderly care, analysing their benefits for the elderly.},

@article{razavi2019dialogue,
abstract = {We address the problem of designing a conversational avatar capable of a sequence of casual conversations with older adults. Users at risk of loneliness, social anxiety or a sense of ennui may benefit from practicing such conversations in private, at their convenience. We describe an automatic spoken dialogue manager for LISSA, an on-screen virtual agent that can keep older users involved in conversations over several sessions, each lasting 10-20 minutes. The idea behind LISSA is to improve users' communication skills by providing feedback on their non-verbal behavior at certain points in the course of the conversations. In this paper, we analyze the dialogues collected from the first session between LISSA and each of 8 participants. We examine the quality of the conversations by comparing the transcripts with those collected in a WOZ setting. LISSA's contributions to the conversations were judged by research assistants who rated the extent to which the contributions were "natural", "on track", "encouraging", "understanding", "relevant", and "polite". The results show that the automatic dialogue manager was able to handle conversation with the users smoothly and naturally.},
